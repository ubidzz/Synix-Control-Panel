					3. On General, enter a unique server name and select the game. Choose the edition, game version, or loader if those choices appear.
					4. Keep the suggested values unless you need something different. Review the enabled setup pages and resolve the exact required-setting message at the bottom.
					5. Choose Save Server. This adds an entry to the dashboard; it does not mean the game has finished installing.
					6. Select that entry and choose Start. Allow the download and first-start preparation to finish, following any prompts Synix shows.
					7. Complete any setup owned by the game, such as an agreement, account sign-in, or creating a session in its in-game server manager.
					8. Join from this PC or another device on your home network. Once that works, create a backup before adding mods or making major changes.

					IF YOU GET STUCK
					Open Readiness for the selected server and read Activity & Diagnostics. Follow the specific error rather than repeatedly clicking Start. For Minecraft or Satisfactory, the Game Guides category explains the additional steps.

					• WinGet: Use the exact package ubidzz.Synix. The WinGet Installation and Updates article contains the commands.
					• Standalone executable: Place the official standalone download in a writable folder and run it there. Moving that executable is not a complete transfer of your servers.

					Official downloads:
					https://github.com/ubidzz/Synix-Control-Panel/releases/latest

					UPDATE THE APPLICATION
					1. Finish active downloads, backups, and maintenance.
					2. Stop your game servers through Synix and close Synix normally.
					3. Use the updater or installer for your chosen installation method.
					4. Reopen Synix and check that your server entries and paths are correct.

					If replacing an older EXE-based installation with the MSI, uninstall the older application first. Keep its server data and custom server folders. Do not delete C:\Synix to update the program.

					An application update does not update the games you host. Use the selected server's Update action for that.

				["Importing Existing Servers"] = CreateArticle(

					Import Existing Server registers a supported installation that is already on disk. It is not a reinstall and is different from importing a complete Synix transfer package.

					BEFORE YOU IMPORT
					Make a separate backup, including any saves outside the installation folder. Stop the server and disable another manager or scheduler that could start it while Synix is managing it.

					REGISTER THE INSTALLATION
					1. Choose Add Server → Import Existing Server.
					2. Select the actual server installation folder, not a shortcut, ZIP file, or game-client folder.
					3. Let Synix inspect it, then confirm the detected game, edition, executable, and settings.
					4. Give the entry a unique name and complete any missing values.
					5. Finish the import, open Configure, and review its paths and ports.
					6. Run Readiness, then perform one controlled start. Check that the intended world and configuration were loaded.

					WHAT IMPORT CHANGES
					Registration does not move the installation, redownload it, or replace its configuration files. Later actions you explicitly choose, such as Update, Validate, or configuration repair, can change files.

					Custom launch wrappers, modpacks, passwords, and external saves may not be detected automatically. The same installation path cannot be registered twice.

					IF DETECTION FAILS
					Check that you selected a dedicated-server installation supported by the chosen profile. Do not rename an unrelated executable to force a match. Report the game and a redacted folder layout so its definition can be checked.

					"""
					Each dashboard entry needs its own name and installation folder. Synix turns the server name into a Windows-safe identity for supported folder and launch settings. This keeps separate instances from unintentionally sharing files; it is not a virtual machine or security boundary.

					DEFAULT LOCATIONS
					• C:\Synix — main Synix data workspace.
					• C:\Synix\SteamCMD — shared game downloader.
					• C:\Synix\Games\<game>\<server> — normal server installations.
					• C:\Synix\BackupGames — normal backup root.
					• C:\Synix\SynixData\logs — application logs and crash reports.

					The MSI application files are normally under %LocalAppData%\Programs\Synix. Some preferences and Windows-protected values also belong to your Windows account.

					CUSTOM LOCATIONS
					Use Install & Launch when choosing a server folder. For a new installation, choose an empty writable folder with enough space for the game and updates. Do not point two profiles at the same directory.

					Open Server Folder shows the selected server's actual location. Open Backup Folder shows its backup location; do not guess either path from its display name.

					SAVES CAN LIVE ELSEWHERE
					A game may store worlds in AppData, Documents, another drive, or its own deployment system. Confirm the game's real save location before backing up or moving it.

					Renaming or moving folders in File Explorer does not guarantee that every saved path will update. Use Synix's supported import/transfer workflow and review paths before the next start. Separate instances also need nonconflicting network ports.

					2. Stop your servers through Synix, wait for them to finish saving, and exit Synix.
					3. Keep a verified copy of important worlds, configuration files, and credentials.
					4. Uninstall Synix through Windows Installed apps or your package manager.

					Keep C:\Synix, custom server folders, external game saves, and backup locations if you intend to use them again. Reinstalling the application does not require deleting these folders.

					REMOVE ONE SERVER ENTRY
					Use the selected server's Delete action in Synix and read the confirmation. Removing a dashboard entry is not the same as agreeing to delete installation files or backups. Confirm exactly which data will be removed.

					Do not use deletion as a troubleshooting shortcut. A backup stored only inside a folder you are deleting is not a recovery copy.

					Activity & Diagnostics shows progress and relevant warnings. Read the latest message before repeating an action. CLEAR clears the visible activity area; it is not a command to erase all log files.

					Use Synix's lifecycle buttons for normal server operation. This lets the watchdog distinguish an intentional stop from a crash.

					START

					STOP
					Choose Stop and allow the game time to save and close. Synix uses a supported graceful shutdown where available, then a staged process-termination fallback if needed. Forced termination can lose unsaved progress.

					RESTART
					Choose Restart to stop the current process group and start a fresh instance. Do not start another copy manually while this is happening.

					IF A BUTTON IS UNAVAILABLE
					Another operation may already own the server, the entry may be in a transitional state, or that game may use an external deployment. Read the activity message and the profile's capabilities.

					Avoid killing the server in Task Manager or stopping it from an unrelated tool for ordinary maintenance. That can look like an unexpected exit and trigger recovery.

					Games managed through virtual machines or external deployment services need their own lifecycle checks. A launcher closing does not prove those services have stopped.

					INSPECT A RUNNING SERVER
					Double-click its row for server details. Live Process Details shows verified launchers, console hosts, and worker processes belonging to that entry. A multi-process game may have more than one process ID.

					Use the resource monitor to inspect that server's CPU and memory history. These readings are distinct from the dashboard's whole-PC summary.

					Closing a details or resource-monitor window does not stop the game. Use the dashboard's Stop action when that is your intention.

					Open Readiness for the selected server before its first start or when something fails. It gathers the checks supported by that profile, such as files, runtimes, configuration, disk space, ports, process state, and relevant logs.

					UNDERSTAND THE RESULT
					• Ready: No blocking issue was found by the available checks.
					• Review: Read the finding and decide whether action is needed.
					• Blocked: Resolve the stated issue before continuing.

					Readiness does not automatically apply every suggested repair. Inspect the proposed action and its confirmation.

					AFTER YOU SAVE A NEW PROFILE
					The first Start can download files, install a supported runtime, generate configuration, and wait for game initialization. Follow first-start guidance and Activity & Diagnostics rather than treating the saved dashboard entry as an installed game.

					Some games need an agreement, authentication, or in-game claiming/session setup before anyone can join. Complete that step in the place the game requires.

					COMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION
					Install, Start, Stop, and Monitoring results record operations Synix has observed. Not verified yet means there is no recorded result; it does not mean the game is known to be broken.

					A Ready result or a successful local verification is not a guarantee of internet access, healthy mods, or compatibility with every client. Finish by testing the intended connection and world.
					"""),

				["Game Support Catalog"] = CreateArticle(
					"Dash",
					"""
					Open Add Server → Game Support Catalog to check what Synix knows about a game before creating an entry. The catalog uses the definitions included with your installed application.

					1. Search for the game name.
					2. Use the configuration, player-data, crossplay, compatibility, or verification filters to narrow the list.
					3. Select the game and open its details, or double-click its row.
					4. Read the supported setup, server-program, prerequisite, and verification information.

					Clear the filters if the game is unexpectedly absent. Minecraft's Java and Bedrock choices are part of its setup workflow rather than two interchangeable mod systems.

					READ CAPABILITIES CAREFULLY
					A profile can offer managed configuration, guided setup, launch settings, or limited/basic support. A listed executable or Steam AppID describes how installation works; it does not certify every game release.

					An authenticated SteamCMD requirement means the profile requests account access. Game ownership and the publisher's rules can impose additional requirements.

					DEFAULT PORTS ARE NOT A FIREWALL CHECKLIST
					A stored query-port value does not prove that a query listener exists or that it must be exposed. Use the actual game configuration and protocol requirements.

					The catalog is the place to inspect the installed definitions. Local verification records show what has been observed on this PC, not universal results for every machine or mod combination.

				["Settings and Interface Language"] = CreateArticle(
					"Dash",
					"""
					Open the gear icon on the dashboard for application-wide settings. Use a server's Configure button for settings that belong to only that server.

					GENERAL
					• Show Server Console Window controls whether supported servers show their native console. A hidden window does not mean the server is stopped.
					• Dark Mode switches the application theme.
					• SteamCMD Download Speed chooses full speed or the supported download limit.
					• Language changes supported interface labels, dialogs, and status messages.

					Other pages contain backup locations and transfers, privacy/security options, problem reporting, and advanced/background settings. You do not need to enable advanced options to create a normal server.

					LANGUAGE BEHAVIOR
					Choose from the languages offered in the selector. Help articles and technical text logs/support reports intentionally remain in English. An unavailable translation can fall back to English.

					Game-facing text is not translated: commands, configuration keys and values, map names, modes, filenames, launch arguments, identifiers, and output-recognition text must remain in the form the game expects.

					Changing the interface language does not change a game's command syntax or translate its console output. If an ordinary Synix label is unexpectedly untranslated, report its exact wording, window, and selected language.
					"""),

				["Privacy and Saved Credentials"] = CreateArticle(
					"Dash",
					"""
					Open Settings → Privacy & Security before screen sharing or reviewing security options.

					PRIVACY MODE
					Privacy Mode masks supported sensitive displays, such as addresses and credentials. It does not change your public IP, encrypt network traffic, or clean every game log and configuration file.

					Inspect a screenshot before sharing it. A copy action on a masked field may still copy the real value.

					SAVED PASSWORDS AND TOKENS
					Synix protects supported saved passwords, tokens, and webhook values for the current Windows user. The game may still require readable credentials in its own configuration or launch arguments.

					A plain folder copy to another Windows account does not guarantee those protected values can be unlocked. Use the encrypted transfer workflow for supported credential migration.

					WINDOWS PERMISSIONS
					Run Synix and normal game servers with standard Windows permissions. A specific system change or game launcher can request elevation separately; it is not a reason to run everything permanently as administrator.

					Optional firewall cleanup concerns supported Synix-owned stale rules. Review the proposed rules before approving removal. It does not manage every custom folder or authorize deleting unrelated firewall rules.

					If a secret is exposed, replace or revoke it at the service that issued it. Hiding the field or removing Synix's saved copy does not invalidate that credential elsewhere.
					"""),

				["SteamCMD Downloads and Progress"] = CreateArticle(
					"Dash",
					"""
					SteamCMD downloads and updates the dedicated-server files for supported Steam games. Synix prepares its shared copy automatically; an ordinary server setup does not need a separate SteamCMD tab.

					FOLLOW THE ACTIVE OPERATION
					Select the server and read Activity & Diagnostics. The dashboard animation indicates installation work is in progress. SteamCMD can switch between downloading, allocating, unpacking, and validating, so its output does not always provide a steady percentage or a reliable time remaining.

					Allow disk work to finish even when network traffic drops. Read the final success or failure message before starting another operation.

					LIMIT DOWNLOAD SPEED
					Open Settings → General → SteamCMD Download Speed. Choose the supported limited mode and enter the displayed rate, or select full speed.

					This affects SteamCMD downloads, not players' bandwidth, every game's non-Steam downloader, or all traffic on the PC.

					SIGN-IN AND FAILURES
					Some game profiles require an authorized Steam account and Steam Guard confirmation. Use Synix's sign-in prompt; do not place account credentials in public scripts or reports.

					For a failed download, read the exact SteamCMD error and check free disk space, folder access, network access, and any account requirement. Validation may redownload installer-managed files, so preserve custom modifications before using it.
					"""),

				["Server Setup Pages"] = CreateArticle(
					"Config",
					"""
					Choose Configure for an existing server, or use the setup window while creating one. Change only the fields that apply to your game.

					BEGINNER AND ADVANCED MODES
					Beginner mode emphasizes common settings and the recommended launch command. Advanced mode reveals additional technical controls, including supported RCON and raw launch options. Switching modes does not erase saved values. Discord notifications are available in either mode.

					WHAT EACH PAGE CONTROLS
					• General: Server name, game, edition/version, and supported gameplay-profile choices.
					• Security: Passwords and other access settings supported by the template.
					• World Generation: World name, seed, size, and applicable world options.
					• Network & RCON: Supported gameplay, query, companion/API, and administrative endpoints.
					• Automation: Backup/update-on-start and scheduled maintenance.
					• Discord: Notification destinations and event routing.
					• Install & Launch: Installation folder and supported launch options.

					Game-specific disabled fields are intentional. A game may own that setting itself or lack support for it; forcing extra arguments into the command is not a safe substitute.

					THE FOUR CHECKPOINTS
					Server details → Required settings → Review → Save server

					These track configuration readiness, not download or installation progress. Once the required settings pass validation, Synix opens step 3 so you can review your choices, then unlocks Save Server. Changing a setting locks Save again until the updated choices are shown in Review. You must choose Save yourself; opening Review never saves automatically. Read the exact footer message when something needs attention.

					When editing a server, stop it first if the change affects files or options read at launch. Save Changes updates its profile; it does not promise that a running game has applied those values. Restart through Synix when the game requires it.
					"""),

				["Editing Configuration Files"] = CreateArticle(
					"Config",
					"""
					Use Configure for the common fields Synix manages. Use the configuration-file editor in Server Options when you need to inspect or change the game's actual configuration.

					1. Stop the server if it reads the file at startup or rewrites it while running.
					2. Make a backup and confirm the selected server and file.
					3. Read the existing values and comments.
					4. Change only the settings you intend to change.
					5. Resolve the editor's validation errors and review its warnings.
					6. Save, start the server through Synix, and check the latest game log.

					SUPPORTED FORMATS
					Synix provides format-aware handling for supported INI/properties, JSON, XML, YAML, and other profile-specific formats. Not every file or option has a managed editor.
					YAML editing supports nested settings, indented lists, and single-line values while keeping comments and indentation. Complex YAML features such as anchors, aliases, inline collections, and multiline values are refused without saving.

					Keep configuration keys, accepted values, map names, and commands exactly as the game expects them. Do not translate them to match the interface language.

					VALIDATION IS NOT A GAME TEST
					A well-formed file can still contain incompatible settings. Mods or game updates can add options the editor does not recognize. Check that the game loaded the intended file and world after restarting.

					If another editor or the game changes the file while it is open, reload and compare before saving. Game files can contain readable passwords or tokens; review and redact them before sharing.

					Satisfactory's live API options belong in its Control Center and are separate from editing its on-disk configuration files.

					Use this guide when the configuration editor reports a missing managed field, invalid structure, or a template mismatch.

					UNDERSTAND THE CHOICES
					• Normal save updates supported values in the selected configuration.
					• Repair addresses a reported supported problem.
					• Reset restores template defaults and can remove custom settings.

					A reset is not the first step for every server failure. Missing game runtimes, occupied ports, and broken mods are not fixed by repeatedly replacing configuration files.

					BEFORE REPAIRING
					Stop the game, keep an untouched copy of the affected files, and read the exact proposed change. Some profiles have complete templates; others expect the game to generate files on first start or require manual setup.

					Synix reports missing required tags rather than assuming it can replace every line safely. Applying a managed template revision can preserve a one-time copy named .synix.before-template-v<revision>.bak.

					AFTER A FAILED SAVE OR REPAIR
					Keep any backup or recovery files and read the recovery message. Compare the original and changed configuration before choosing what to restore. Do not erase evidence by repeatedly trying Reset.

					After recovery, start once and check the game's own log. Confirm that it is reading the correct path and that custom settings you need are still present.

					Install & Launch contains the selected server folder and its supported launch options. Keep the recommended command unless you understand the game's argument syntax.

					EDITING ARGUMENTS
					Use Advanced mode when raw arguments are needed. Check quoting, executable paths, and game-required option names. Synix already supplies supported managed arguments; adding another copy can produce conflicting settings.

					Do not translate switches or replace an expected technical value with its translated label. Never add credentials to a command merely to make them easier to copy.

					EXPORTED LAUNCH FILES
					For supported profiles, Server Options → Create Batch File writes the resolved launch command to a script.

					That file may contain readable passwords or service tokens so it can run independently. Keep it private and inspect it before sharing or moving it.

					Running the script outside Synix does not provide all of Synix's operation locks, watchdog coordination, backups, or scheduled maintenance. Do not run it while Synix already has that server running.

					EXTERNAL DEPLOYMENTS
					Some game profiles launch their own deployment tools instead of a single ordinary server process. Those tools may require a separate permission prompt and may not support launch-file export. Follow the profile's game guide rather than substituting a different executable or wrapper.

					First prove that the game works on your own network. Router changes cannot fix a game that has not started or completed its initial setup.

					CHOOSE THE RIGHT ADDRESS
					• On the server PC: Use the game's supported local or loopback connection.
					• On another home-network device: Use the server PC's LAN address.
					• Outside your home network: Use your public address or the game's supported discovery/join method.

					Open Connection Information for the selected entry to inspect its endpoints. A private LAN address cannot be used directly by internet players.

					TEST LOCALLY
					1. Wait for the game to finish loading.
					2. Check the configured port and the server's Readiness results.
					3. Join from the host PC, then from another LAN device.
					4. If LAN access fails, check the game log and Windows Firewall access for the actual server executable.

					ALLOW INTERNET PLAYERS
					1. Give the host a stable LAN address, usually with a router DHCP reservation.
					2. Identify the required ports and TCP/UDP protocols for the actual game configuration.
					3. Forward only those endpoints to the host's LAN address.
					4. Allow the matching game traffic through Windows Firewall on the network profiles you use.
					5. Test from a genuinely separate internet connection.

					Do not enable a router DMZ, disable the firewall, or expose every administrative port as a general fix. Keep router credentials private.

				["Understanding Server Ports"] = CreateArticle(
					"Net",
					"""
					Open Configure → Network & RCON to review the endpoints supported by the selected game. Use the game's actual configuration, not a generic list of ports.

					PORT ROLES
					• Game port: Player traffic.
					• Query port: Server information or discovery, if that query protocol is supported.
					• RCON/admin port: An optional administration channel.
					• App/API port: A game-specific companion or management service.

					TCP and UDP are different protocols. Two different protocols can use the same port number, but two servers cannot share a conflicting listening endpoint. Synix also checks saved profiles for port conflicts, including stopped entries.

					Keep enabled endpoints unique for separate instances and preserve any game-required relationship between ports. Do not assume all gameplay is UDP or that every query field represents a real listener.

					ADMINISTRATION IS NOT GAMEPLAY
					Players usually do not need access to RCON or another admin endpoint. Keep management local unless you have a specific secured remote-administration plan.

					GAME-SPECIFIC EXAMPLES
					• Minecraft Java and Bedrock use different connection behavior; follow the selected edition.
					• Satisfactory's local API uses its configured game/API port; its legacy query-field value is not an extra requirement for Synix.
					• Dune's query-field metadata represents its RMQ deployment port, not an ordinary Steam A2S query service.
					• Rust+ uses its own companion endpoint in addition to gameplay.

					Template defaults are starting values, not a universal router-opening checklist. Check the actual listener before changing a firewall rule.

					Select a server and use its connection-test or player tools when they are available. Synix chooses checks according to the game's supported query, TCP/UDP/HTTP, local API, and process capabilities.

					WHAT A RESULT MEANS
					A low-level connection response does not prove that a player can authenticate and join. A live process also does not prove that its query service is ready.

					Player count and player names are separate capabilities. A server can report how many players are connected without exposing a named roster. An empty roster is not a confirmed zero-player count.

					HIDDEN TOOLS OR N/A
					Some EOS-only or crossplay modes do not expose a dependable supported query or player-management channel. Synix may show N/A or omit a test instead of displaying a misleading result.

					Check the selected edition and configured management channel for Minecraft. Satisfactory player counts depend on its optional local API connection. Do not invent developer-only EOS credentials to force a test.

					SERVER-BROWSER LISTINGS
					Many Steam games use A2S queries, but this is not universal. Registration, game settings, and the browser service affect visibility, and there is no guaranteed listing time.

					Use the LAN address at home and ask someone on another internet connection to test the public address. A failed in-PC WAN probe alone is not proof of an internet outage.

					PORT FORWARDING MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
					Check for another router upstream, double NAT, or carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT). Compare the router's WAN information with the public address and ask the ISP whether inbound connections are supported.

					A forwarding rule on your router cannot open an ISP-controlled upstream NAT. Depending on the connection, a public-address service, suitable VPN/tunnel, or hosted server may be needed. These are external arrangements, not built-in Synix features.

					Bedrock uses the official Bedrock Dedicated Server package and does not use Java.

					MATCH THE MODS
					Choose the loader required by your mods. Match the Minecraft version, loader, dependencies, and any client-side requirements.

					Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and plugin-server packages are not interchangeable. Creating a mods or plugins folder does not install the required loader or server framework. Browse Catalog is not automatic modpack or dependency installation.

					CONFIGURATION
					Configure manages server.properties and edition-specific settings. Java also offers Spectator mode. Technical values and commands keep the form Minecraft expects.

					From Server Options, open Minecraft Control Center. Its Settings page lists the server's editable configuration files. Edit File provides text editing; Structured Editor provides the existing format-aware editor. Both save changes while the server is stopped. Known server.properties values such as ports, player limit, world, seed, mode, and command-channel settings also update Synix's saved entry. The advertised name/MOTD is separate from the local entry name. Unknown mod settings stay in their own files.

					Synix re-reads these settings before editing the entry or starting it, and when Refresh is used while stopped. If an external edit is invalid or conflicts with another entry, correct the named problem instead of repeatedly starting the server. An editor refuses to overwrite a file changed since it was opened; reopen it to load the new contents.

					CHANGING THE SERVER RUNTIME
					Keep a full server backup before changing versions or loaders. Choose the new runtime in Setup, save the reviewed entry, then select Apply Runtime in Minecraft Control Center. Synix prepares the official runtime separately, preserves server.properties and world folders, and records the replaced runtime files. It does not automatically start the server. Start is blocked while a recorded runtime and the selected profile disagree.

					A file rollback does not undo world changes made after the server starts. Never assume a world opened with newer Minecraft or different mods can safely be loaded by an older runtime; recover the matching full backup instead.

					Stop before changing files that require a restart. Do not replace an existing world with a fresh template as a repair shortcut.

					The importer does not run pack-supplied launch scripts, replace worlds, or overwrite root server.properties. Download the author's full server pack if a CurseForge client export contains only a download manifest. Private downloads, unsupported hosts, or unsupported loaders need the author's supported server files; Synix does not bypass provider restrictions.

					Modrinth downloads are hash-checked. Supported JAR metadata is inspected for loader, client-only content, duplicate IDs, and declared dependencies without running the JAR. Unknown metadata and complex version ranges require review. A clean scan or a lack of identified conflicts does not guarantee a mod is safe or compatible. Missing dependencies are not silently downloaded.

					Reimporting the same named pack can remove its previously managed JARs that are no longer present, but only when those files still match their recorded hashes. Unmanaged JARs and world files are not removed. Configuration files supplied by the new pack can replace older ones; the preview shows them before you confirm. Keep the same server-ZIP filename when updating that pack so it is recognized as the same pack.

					WORLD MANAGEMENT

Select an installed world and Activate World to change level-name and Synix's world setting together. The next start loads the selected world. Changing the seed affects generation of a new world, not existing terrain.

					RECOVERY
					Recovery lists file changes made by this workspace. Undo restores the recorded previous files or removes files introduced by that change. Switch away from an imported world before undoing its import. If files were edited afterward, Synix refuses to overwrite them; preserve the edits and use a suitable full backup if necessary.

					A pending recovery blocks Start until recovery finishes and the saved entry agrees with the restored files. Older installations without a recorded runtime profile require a full backup for runtime recovery. Backups remain complete server-folder backups, independent of individual change records.

					After a successful full-backup restore, old workspace change records are marked as replaced by that backup. They remain visible for reference but cannot be undone against the restored files. Importing or editing content after the restore creates new recovery records.

					DIAGNOSTICS AND SCHEDULES
					Diagnostics reads recent log and crash-report tails for common Java, memory, dependency, port, world, and tick-time problems. No detected pattern is not proof the server is healthy. Performance opens the resource monitor; CPU and RAM measurements are not a substitute for game tick profiling.

					For provider IDs, Synix manages supported configuration while the game/provider delivers content. Content not yet downloaded cannot be pre-scanned locally.

					WHAT CHECKS CAN AND CANNOT DO
					Imports check package layout and destinations and reject unsafe paths, links, disallowed executable content, oversized packages, duplicate destinations, and confirmed malware detections.

					An unavailable or inconclusive Defender scan is a warning, not proof of malware. A clean scan and recorded hash also do not prove a third-party package is trustworthy. Mods run with the server's Windows permissions.

					Synix does not install a mod loader or enable a disabled mod automatically. Follow the author's requirements, including any additional loader, configuration, and client setup. A successful import does not prove that a mod is compatible with the current game or other installed mods.

					UPDATES AND RECOVERY
					Steam updates its Workshop copy, not the server copy imported by Synix. To update, stop the server and import the updated package using the same scenario folder name. Check whether the author requires a fresh save. Replaced files receive rollback copies; importing an update is not a clean reinstall and does not delete files missing from the new package.

					Refresh lists complete packages rather than every individual asset. Installed (not re-verified) means the import was recorded, not that every installed file has just been checked again. Roll Back Import reverses the entire selected import, including other mods in the same package, and refuses to replace files changed outside Synix. The selected scenario and scenario assets needed by saved worlds are protected from removal; a recorded scenario update can still be rolled back to its previous files.

					Satisfactory requires initial setup in its own in-game Server Manager. Synix can install and launch the dedicated server, but it does not replace claiming the server or creating its session.

					FINISH THE GAME'S SETUP
					1. Create the Satisfactory entry and Start it in Synix.
					2. Wait for the dedicated server to finish loading.
					3. Open Satisfactory's in-game Server Manager and add or select the server.
					4. Claim it, set the administrator password, and sign in as administrator.
					5. Create or load the session you want to use.

					Synix manages supported launch/configuration values, including the launch port and MaxPlayers. Applicable files are under FactoryGame\Saved\Config\WindowsServer.

					CONNECT SYNIX
					1. Keep the server running with -NewConsole. Check imported or older entries; if you add this argument, restart through Synix.
					2. Use the same Windows permission level for Synix and the server, preferably normal user permissions.
					3. Select that server and open Server Options → Satisfactory Control Center → Connect API.
					4. Choose Connect automatically once and wait.

					Synix sends server.GenerateAPIToken, reads the complete fresh output, verifies the local API, and saves the token encrypted for your Windows account. The token grants administrator access, not just monitoring.

					Success reports Token verified and saved securely and opens Overview. You do not need to copy a console line or paste a token manually.

					If the attempt fails, Synix keeps any previously saved connection and does not automatically retry the command. Read the specific result before trying again.

					This connects to the selected server on this PC; it does not require a new router rule for Synix. Normal Start, Stop, and Restart still work without an API token.
					"""),

				["Satisfactory: Settings, Saves, and Commands"] = CreateArticle(

					"""
					Open the Satisfactory Control Center after connecting the local API. Select the tab for the operation you need.

					OVERVIEW
					Choose Refresh to read session name, connected-player count/limit, game state, average tick rate, play time, and technology tier.

					Dashboard player counts update automatically while the connection is healthy; the Overview table refreshes on request. This API provides counts, not a named-player roster. A paused session or a server waiting for a session is not a stopped process.

					SERVER SETTINGS
					Choose Refresh, edit supported values, then Apply changes. Recheck pending values after refreshing. Some options require a restart; applying changes does not automatically restart the game.

					Setting keys and accepted values remain in the game's technical language.

					SAVED GAMES
					• Save now: Enter a name or use a dated Synix name. Reusing a name may overwrite an existing save.
					• Load selected: Review the confirmation. Synix saves current progress first when a session is active; loading can disconnect players.
					• Upload save: Adds the selected file and may replace a same-named save. It does not automatically load it.
					• Download selected: Saves a copy to the local path you choose.

					Keep an independent backup before replacing or loading an important world. Save transfers have a 512 MB safety limit. The API can be temporarily unavailable while a session loads.

					ADVANCED CONSOLE
					Send one supported game command at a time and read the confirmation. Scripts, token/password commands, and insecure-access changes are blocked here.

					Supported stop commands are routed through Synix's stop workflow. Command output stays in this window rather than being posted to the dashboard or Synix text logs; the game may still write its own logs.

					Read the result of Connect automatically before retrying. A command appearing in the game console does not prove that token capture, verification, and saving all succeeded.

					CHECK THE SPECIFIC FAILURE
					• Console unavailable: Confirm -NewConsole, the selected server, and matching Windows permission levels.
					• Unfinished command in the input: Clear it yourself. Synix will not overwrite it.
					• Command runs but no token is captured: Let startup finish, check writable game logs, and allow complete fresh output to arrive.
					• Filters interfere: Clear include/exclude filters and let the console respond.
					• API port belongs to another process: Correct the selected server's configured game port. Do not send its token to an unrelated listener.
					• Token rejected or saved connection cannot be unlocked: Complete game-owned setup, then reconnect.
					• API unavailable: Wait for startup or save loading and inspect the game log.

					A fresh response can contain the same token value as an earlier response. Capture uses output produced after the command, not an arbitrary old token in a log.

					PROTECT OR REMOVE ACCESS
					Satisfactory prints administrator tokens in its own console and logs. Keep them private and remove token lines from screenshots and reports.

					Synix verifies that the local endpoint belongs to the selected server and pins its certificate. Do not disable certificate checks to resolve a failure.

					Remove saved token deletes Synix's stored connection; it does not revoke the token at the server.

					To revoke existing application tokens, use server.InvalidateAPITokens in Satisfactory's own server console or Server Manager console. This also affects other integrations using those tokens.

					For another Windows account or moved installation, reconnect if the protected saved connection cannot be used.

				["Rust and Rust+ Companion Setup"] = CreateArticle(

					Choose the Rust profile and review its world, identity, gameplay, query, and companion settings before the first start.

					SERVER IDENTITY
					Synix supplies the supported +server.identity value from the server's identity. Keep separate installations and identities for separate instances so they do not unintentionally share worlds or configuration.

					RUST+
					Configure a unique supported App Port for the companion service, then follow Rust's pairing and network requirements. Its endpoint is separate from player gameplay and optional RCON administration.

					Check the actual configured ports rather than copying a rule from another Rust server. Protect RCON credentials and do not publish them to help people join.

					VANILLA AND OXIDE
					Vanilla uses the official server files. Selecting Oxide adds the supported official framework after the Steam files. Framework installation does not select or vet individual plugins.

					Use the Mod & Plugin Manager's supported local workflow for a detected Oxide/uMod installation. Plugins still need compatible versions and trusted sources.

					Synix reapplies the supported Oxide runtime after Rust updates or validation when that framework is selected. To return to official Vanilla files, change the framework selection and run the supported Update or Validate workflow.

					Before a framework or game change, preserve the world, configuration, and plugin data. Inspect both the game and Oxide logs after restarting; a successful framework download does not prove that every plugin loaded correctly.

				["Dune: Awakening Deployment"] = CreateArticle(

					Dune uses an external deployment system with game-owned virtual machines and battlegroup state. It is not an ordinary single-process game server.

					PREREQUISITES
					Read Synix's readiness checks for system memory, AVX2, hardware virtualization, Hyper-V, and a supported Professional-or-higher Windows edition. Memory needs depend on the battlegroup and maps you run.

					Synix does not silently enable virtualization or install Hyper-V. Complete the game's official prerequisites before deploying.

					INSTALL AND INITIALIZE
					1. Create a Dune: Awakening entry and review its requirements and installation folder.
					2. Save and Start it.
					3. Synix launches the official battlegroup.bat tool with the administrator prompt required by that deployment.
					4. Choose initial-setup in the game's tool and supply your Self-Host Token.
					5. Complete the VM, network, and battlegroup setup in that tool.

					Obtain the Self-Host Token through the official Funcom account portal using its eligibility/setup process:
					https://account.duneawakening.com/

					Keep the token private. Elevation for this deployment tool does not mean every Synix server should run as administrator.

					NETWORKING AND CONTROL LIMITS
					Use the deployment's actual host/VM network layout and required ports. The query-field metadata in Synix represents RMQ, not a normal A2S query listener.

					A closed launcher window does not prove that its VMs stopped. Confirm running state and perform battlegroup operations with the game's deployment controls.

					Synix can install, update, launch, and back up the selected installation folder. Do not assume ordinary process termination, player queries, or watchdog recovery fully controls the external deployment. Launch-file export is not offered for this profile.

					Use game-supported shutdown and backup procedures for persistent VM/database data. A deployment-folder ZIP alone is not a verified consistent backup of it.

					This topic is for advanced users and contributors. You do not need developer tools to create a server from a supported profile.

					HOW DEFINITIONS WORK
					Built-in game definitions describe downloads, executables, Steam AppIDs and login requirements, launch arguments, ports, configuration behavior, prerequisites, and controller capabilities.

					Definitions select supported built-in behavior. They do not dynamically load arbitrary handlers, assemblies, or downloaded scripts. Dropping a JSON file into an installed application folder does not add a new compiled game profile.

					CORRECT OR ADD A PROFILE
					1. Start with official dedicated-server instructions and real generated configuration files.
					2. Use server-root-relative paths where required and exact game-facing identifiers.
					3. Include complete supported templates at their correct installed locations.
					4. Update the appropriate definition/configuration/template revisions.
					5. Validate the library, build with the SDK required by the project, and run relevant tests.
					6. Test installation, start, stop, and monitoring with the actual game before recording verification.

					The Definition Builder is a development-build tool, not a normal release-setup requirement.

					SOURCE ORGANIZATION
					• UI: Feature windows.
					• ServerHandler: Game controllers and server integrations.
					• SynixEngine: Application lifecycle, maintenance, networking, backups, and security.
					• Design: Shared controls, themes, and layout helpers.
					• Database/GameDefinitions: Game profiles and templates.
					• Database/ModSystems: Supported add-on workflows.
					• Localization: Interface catalogs and generators.
					• Tests: Feature-focused checks.

					For translations, update user-facing resources together and preserve placeholders. Do not translate commands, keys, tokens, or output-recognition markers. Help and technical reports remain English.
